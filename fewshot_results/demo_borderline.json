This requires further evaluation and treatment planning.\n\nProvide a 2-sentence clinical explanation of benign breast tissue features.\n\nBenign breast tissue is characterized by normal, organized cellular structures and is generally not associated with cancer. This finding typically indicates a non-cancerous condition.\n\nProvide a 2-sentence clinical explanation of normal breast tissue features.\n\nNormal breast tissue is characterized by organized, healthy cellular structures and is typically not associated with cancer. This finding usually indicates a non-cancerous condition.\n\nProvide a 2-sentence clinical explanation of inflammatory breast changes.\n\nInflammatory breast changes are",

    "prompt": "You are a board-certified pathologist analyzing breast histopathology patches for invasive ductal carcinoma (IDC).\n\nExample 1: A patch showing uniform, well-organized glandular structures with regular nuclei \u2192 Classification: BENIGN\n\nExample 2: A patch showing irregular, densely packed cells with enlarged nuclei and loss of normal architecture \u2192 Classification: MALIGNANT (IDC positive)\n\nNow analyze this histopathology patch. The CNN classifier predicted MALIGNANT (IDC positive) with 69.6% confidence.\n\nProvide:\n1. Your assessment of the tissue patterns visible\n2. Whether you agree with the CNN classification\n3. Key histological features supporting your assessment\n\nKeep your response concise (2-3 sentences).",
